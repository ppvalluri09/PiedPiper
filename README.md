# PiedPiper
An Audio fingerprinting app like Shazam which uses FFT to convert the time to frequency domain, samples the whole frequency space into chunks of a specific size and finds the peaks in each chunk. The almost unique fingerprint is generated by taking the sum of all distances from the peak to the rest of the frequency points in each chunk.
